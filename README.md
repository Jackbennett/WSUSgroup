# Create GPO's for WSUS Targets

Manually making GPO's is rubbish, especially when it's repetative.

This script just prompts for the group names you want in the GPO ready for you to enable the link manually in the OU of your choice.

Nice consistent GPO name format `Set - WSUS Group <fisrt group entered>` should keep things very clear in your AD. 

Should compliment your parent GPO that sets all the options for WSUS source installation and times.
